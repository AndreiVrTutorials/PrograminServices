# ⚙️ Java Process Programming

Welcome to my repository for learning **process and concurrent programming in Java**! 🚀  
Here I’ll collect notes, examples, and experiments while studying concepts such as threads, synchronization, and inter-process communication.

## 💡 What is Process Programming?

**Process programming** focuses on managing multiple tasks running at the same time.  
In Java, this means learning how to handle **threads, concurrency, and parallelism** to build efficient and responsive applications. ⚡

## 🔑 Key Topics

- 🧵 **Threads** — Creating and managing independent flows of execution.  
- 🔒 **Synchronization** — Ensuring safe access to shared resources.  
- ⏳ **Concurrency Utilities** — Using `ExecutorService`, `Future`, and `Callable` for modern multithreading.  
- 📡 **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** — Techniques for communication between processes.  
- ⚙️ **Parallelism** — Leveraging multiple cores for faster computations.  
- 🛠️ **Java Concurrency API** — Tools for managing locks, semaphores, and concurrent collections.
